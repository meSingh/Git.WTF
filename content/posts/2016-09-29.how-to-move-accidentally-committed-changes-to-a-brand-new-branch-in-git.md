```bash
# create a new branch from the current state of master
git branch some-new-branch-name
# this is were your commit will live :)
```

```bash
# now go back to master
git checkout master
# remove the commit from the master branch
git reset HEAD~ --hard
# whoola!! you are back on track
```

<!--break-->

#### the other way of doing this:

```bash
# undo the last commit, but leave the changes available
git reset HEAD~ --soft
git stash
# move to the correct branch
git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
git stash pop
git add . # or add individual files
git commit -m "your message here"
# now your changes are on the correct branch
```

A lot of people suggest using cherry-pick for this situation too, so take your pick on whatever one makes the most sense to you!

#### yet another way:

```bash
git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
# grab the last commit to master
git cherry-pick master
# delete it from master
git checkout master
git reset HEAD~ --hard
```
