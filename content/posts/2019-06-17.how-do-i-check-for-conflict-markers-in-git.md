While using git you might run into a problem where you want to perform code merging and merge conflict occured. 
This usually happens when there are two different commits in the same file and git can't identify which commit to keeping. 
Fortunately, there is a git command which can help.

### To detect conflict markers
```shell
git diff --check
```
