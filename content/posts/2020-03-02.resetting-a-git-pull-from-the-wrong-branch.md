I don't know about you, but this happens with me all the time, I accidentally take a pull in the wrong branch, then curse a bit, call my self some name ðŸ¤¬, and then apply this fix. This fix has been a lifesaver for me, and it's also effortless if you understand the concept well enough.

Let's say you pulled in a ```develop``` branch into your ```master``` and the code is not yet ready to go live, now the good thing about git is that it always keep a copy of your remote at ```ORIG_HEAD``` so if you need to revert to it, you can tell git to reset back to remote version by using the following command:

```sh
git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
```

Now, this solution works great in most cases, but some times you only want to move back a few commits, or the merge/pull has not gone through all the way, due to conflicts. In those cases, you can tell git only to discard current changes i.e.

```sh
git reset --hard
```

or in case of resetting last three commits:

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```
I hope this will save you much headache every month as it does for me ðŸ˜‰

> PS: you can check your HEAD counts on how far you want to go using ```git reflog```
