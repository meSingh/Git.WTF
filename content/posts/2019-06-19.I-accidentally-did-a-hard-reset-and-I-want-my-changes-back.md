If you made `git reset --hard` by mistake, possibilities are you can still get your commit back, as git holds a log of everything for a few days.

This is only valid if your work is backed up, i.e. by committed or stashed.
As git reset --hard will remove uncommitted changes so be careful before going into trouble.

There is a much reliable choice is to run `git reset --keep`.

```shell
git reflog
```

Here you will see a list of your past commits. Choose the SHA of the commit you want to reset it to:

```shell
git reset --hard SHA1234
```
