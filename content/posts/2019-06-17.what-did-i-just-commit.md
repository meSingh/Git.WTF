So, imagine that you just blindly committed changes with ```git commit -a``` and you are not satisfied with the particular content of the commit you just created. You can now show the latest commit on your current HEAD with:

```shell
git show
```

or

```shell
git log -n1 -p
```

If you want to see a file at a specific commit, you can also do this (where ```<commitid>``` is the commit you're interested in):

```shell
git show <commitid>:filename
```
