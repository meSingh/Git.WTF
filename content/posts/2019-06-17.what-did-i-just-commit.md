So, imagine that you just blindly committed changes with `git commit -a` and you are not satisfied with the particular content of the commit you just created. You can now show the latest commit on your current HEAD with:

```shell
git show
# or
git log -n1 -p
```

#### To view a specific commit of a file, do the following:

```shell
git show <commitid>:filename
```
