Tracking down the commit that introduced a bug after a big merge can be quite time consuming. Luckily git offers a great binary search facility in the form of git-bisect. First you have to perform the initial setup:

```shell
 git bisect start         # starts the bisecting session
 git bisect bad           # marks the current revision as bad
 git bisect good revision # marks the last known good revision
 ```

After this git will automatically checkout a revision halfway between the known “good” and “bad” versions. You can now run your specs again and mark the commit as “good” or “bad” accordingly.

```shell
git bisect good # or git bisec bad
```

This process continues until you get to the commit that introduced the bug.
