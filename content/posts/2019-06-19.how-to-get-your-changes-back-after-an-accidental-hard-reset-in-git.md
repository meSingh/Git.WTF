If you made `git reset --hard` by mistake, possibilities are you can still get your commit back, as git holds a log of everything for a few days. This is only valid if your work is backed up, i.e., by committed or stashed. As `git reset --hard` removes uncommitted changes, so be careful before going into trouble.

The much reliable choice is to run the following command.

```shell
git reset --keep
```

Alternately, you can check the list of your past commits and choose the SHA of the commit you want:

```shell
git reflog
```

Now, run the following command to get your changes back:

```shell
git reset --hard SHA1234
```
