Despite all the fixes you try, faulty commits do occasionally make it into the central repository. Still this is no reason to despair, since git offers an easy way to revert single or multiple commits:

#### Revert the commit with the specified id

```shell
git revert c761f5c
```

#### Revert the second to last commit

```shell
git revert HEAD^
```

#### Revert a whole range of commits
```shell
git revert develop~4..develop~2
```

In case you donâ€™t want to create additional revert commits but only apply the necessary changes to your working tree, you can use the ```--no-commit/-n``` option.

```shell
# undo the last commit, but don't create a revert commit
git revert -n HEAD
```

The manual page at ```man 1 git-revert``` list further options and provides some additional examples.
