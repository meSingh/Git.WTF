Ever since macOS 10.12 Sierra update for ssh, people have been facing issue with git prompting for ssh passphrase every time you run any git command.

Although, Itâ€™s been a long time since the release still I see many developers asking me this, so I thought to write a simple solution here.

### What you need to do?

For macOS 10.12 Sierra ```ssh-add -K``` needs to be run after every reboot. To avoid this create ```~/.ssh/config``` with this content.

```bash
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
```

That is all you need to do and you are good to go.
