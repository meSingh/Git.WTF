Shit Happens!! There are times where you named a branch wrong or want to make it more meaningful. Doing it locally is quite simple:

```shell
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

In case you are on a different branch, you can do it like this:

```shell
git branch -d old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

### Rename git branch on remote

In some cases, you might have pushed your branch to remote too, for that you can run the following command to rename it on remote too:

```shell
git push origin :old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

#### To reset the upstream branch for the newly named local branch

Switch to the branch and then run the following command:

```shell
git push origin -u new-branch-name
```
